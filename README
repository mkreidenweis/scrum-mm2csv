These scripts can transform a Freemind mindmap containing Sprint Planning results to a CSV file for printing Task Cards.
The Mindmap has to contain nodes matching /Sprint\s+\d{4}-\d{2,}/ that have the Stories as direct children. 
Tasks that should end up in the CSV file have to be annotated in Freemind by the internal icon "attach" (paper clip).

Prerequisites:
- Perl with XML::Parser

How to use:
    Linux:    Use the MM2CSV.pl file directly, passing it a .mm file as command line parameter
              or supply the Freemind XML to STDIN.
              Sample:   $ ./MM2CSV.pl MM2CSV.t.input.mm
                        $ cat MM2CSV.t.input.mm | ./MM2CSV.pl

    Windows:  Use the MM2CSV.bat wrapper batch file around the Perl script: 
              Create a Shortcut to the .bat file on your Desktop. Now you are able to drop a
              Freemind mindmap file on the Shortcut to have a CSV file named SprintTasks.csv
              be created from it. 
              (The .bat file is currently configured to be used with the Perl 5.8.6 that comes 
              with IBM Rational ClearCase 7 for Windows and might have to be changed for other
              Perl installations)
